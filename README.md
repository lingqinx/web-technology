JavaScript + JSONParse

The assignment aims to write a HTML/JavaScript program, which takes the URL of a JSON document containing US Airlines information, parses the JSON file, and extracts the list of airlines, displaying them in a table. The JavaScript program will be embedded in an HTML file so that it can be executed within a browser.
